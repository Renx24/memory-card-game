## 🧠 How It Works
The game fetches animated movies from the SampleAPIs Movie API.

A random selection of movies is displayed as cards.

Click on each card once and only once — clicking the same card twice ends the game.

Each correct guess increases your score.

The game reshuffles cards after every guess to keep things challenging.

The game tracks your current score and high score.
